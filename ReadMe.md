Class - GUI II
Created a mental health wesbite for our final project that is dedicated to helping people get a better understanding of their wellbeing. 
Features of the website include - a journal for note taking, a calender to set dates and reminders, a log that promps users to input the emotion
they're feeling that day, a graph that displays the users emotions throughout the week, month, or year, and many more. The website was hosted using 
firebase which allows users to login and save their data.
